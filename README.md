# ChatOCR
The project is in complement to UniArchives, integrating ChatGPT into the uploaded content through OCR and letting the user interact with the content. A user is able to query, summarize, or get AI responses against any academic work. It allows users to upload files (PDF, DOCX, PPTX, images) or enter text and perform various AI-powered tasks like summarization, rewriting, explaining, and answering questions. Users can also **specify pages to analyze** for supported file formats.

## Features
